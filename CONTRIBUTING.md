# Contributing to LumenX Studio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LumenX Studio! We welcome contributions from the community.

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute

- **Bug Reports**: Submit detailed bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/lumenx/issues)
- **Feature Requests**: Propose new features through GitHub Issues
- **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes or new features
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation, tutorials, or examples
- **Community Support**: Help others in GitHub Discussions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lumenx.git
cd lumenx

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/lumenx.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the instructions in [README_EN.md](README_EN.md#quick-start) to set up your local environment.

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions or updates

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code (Backend)

We follow **PEP 8** style guide:

```bash
# Format code with black
black src/

# Check with flake8
flake8 src/
```

**Key Points**:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use descriptive variable names

**Example**:
```python
def generate_storyboard(script: str, style: str = "default") -> List[Frame]:
    """Generate storyboard frames from script.
    
    Args:
        script: The input script text
        style: Visual style preset (default: "default")
        
    Returns:
        List of Frame objects with image URLs
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### TypeScript/React Code (Frontend)

We use **ESLint** configuration:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

**Key Points**:
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use `async/await` over promises
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic

**Example**:
```typescript
interface StoryboardProps {
  frames: Frame[];
  onFrameSelect: (frameId: string) => void;
}

export function StoryboardEditor({ frames, onFrameSelect }: StoryboardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

## 💬 Commit Message Convention

We use **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

**Examples**:
```
feat(storyboard): add drag-and-drop frame reordering

fix(video): resolve FFmpeg concurrent processing issue

docs(readme): update installation instructions for Windows
```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### 1. Ensure Quality

Before submitting your PR:

./build_mac.sh  # or build_windows.ps1 on Windows
```

### 2. Update Documentation

- Update README if you've changed functionality
- Add/update docstrings and comments
- Update USER_MANUAL.md if user-facing features changed

### 3. Submit Pull Request
